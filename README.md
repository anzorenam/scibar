--Scintillator fiber 1.4

Final version of scintillator bar simulation (main code from Rocio Garcia)

- Uses make file to compile with multithread.
- Contains detailed description of optical properties of scibar and WLS fiber.
- Birks constant set to 0.208 (materials) and DBL_MAX
- Object hierachy corrected. 
- Energy spectrum from EXPACS (minum energy to cross detector 380MeV).
- Reflectance at the WLS end.

Experiment and simulation don't agree (needs correction on attenuation)

--Scintillator fiber 1.7

Final version of scintillator bar simulation (main code from Rocio Garcia)

- Uses make file to compile with multithread.
- Contains detailed description of optical properties of scibar and WLS fiber.
- Birks constant set to 0.208 (materials) and DBL_MAX
- Object hierachy corrected.
- Energy spectrum from EXPACS (minum energy to cross detector 380MeV).
- Reflectance at the WLS end.
- Attenuation on the fiber corrected.
- Coating reflectance corrected.
- Rise time and decay times for PS and WLS.
